# This is a Red velvet Caake Receipe


###  ***I*** first made a red velvet cake for my friend’s daughter who was turning 13. I thought it would be a suitably impressive cake to celebrate this milestone birthday and becoming a teenager. It’s bright, rich and sweet, and for me resembled everything great about this young girl.

### Red velvet cakes have an exquisite texture, they are smooth and, well, velvety! Traditionally red velvet cakes are layered, but a single cake tin version is just as good and really simple to make. Of course, this classic chocolate cake is best paired with cream cheese icing. To me this in non-negotiable!  I like to lather a thick layer of cream cheese frosting all over the cake, so when you cut a slice, the texture is unexpected and super vibrant!
